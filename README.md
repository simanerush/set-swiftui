# Set Game
A one-player Set game developed using SwiftUI.

## Features

* To draw cards, tap on the red deck underneath. As the number of cards in game decreases, you can draw more cards from the deck.
* As cards get matched, they go to another deck, which makes the game more user-friendly.
* The Rules button features the rules of the game.
* You can easily start new game by pressing the New Game button.

Have fun!
